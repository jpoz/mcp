# MCP Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks to fully comply with the Model Context Protocol specification v2025-03-266.

## Core Protocol Implementation

- [ ] Implement proper protocol version negotiation in `handleInitialize()`
- [ ] Add proper error handling for unsupported protocol versions
- [ ] Implement JSON-RPC batch request processing (currently returns "not supported")
- [ ] Fix HTTP status code in successful responses (using 202 Accepted incorrectly)

## Transport Implementation

- [ ] Complete the SSE implementation for streaming responses
  - [ ] Add event IDs for resumability
  - [ ] Implement `Last-Event-ID` header support
- [ ] Implement HTTP GET endpoint for server-to-client communication
- [ ] Add origin validation for security against DNS rebinding attacks
- [ ] Ensure proper behavior when client disconnects during streaming

## Session Management

- [x] Improve session ID generation to use cryptographically secure IDs
- [x] Keep Track of session state across requests
- [x] Implement session expiration and cleanup
- [ ] Add explicit session termination via HTTP DELETE
- [ ] Return HTTP 404 for expired/invalid sessions

## Request/Response Handling

- [ ] Implement proper timeout handling for requests
- [ ] Add cancellation notification support
- [ ] Add progress notification support
- [ ] Implement proper error mapping for all specified error types

## Notification System

- [ ] Properly track subscriptions to resources (current implementation is a stub)
- [ ] Add notification delivery tracking
- [ ] Implement proper notification routing to appropriate SSE streams

## Tools Support

- [ ] Complete the streaming tools implementation
- [ ] Add proper event handling during tool execution

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add proper authentication and authorization framework
- [ ] Ensure server only binds to localhost when running locally
- [ ] Implement additional security validation for inputs

## Testing & Documentation

- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for all protocol features
- [ ] Create documentation with examples for each capability
- [ ] Add deployment guide with security best practices

## Client Implementation

- [x] Fix recursive GetSessionID() call in client.go (line 85)
- [x] Implement proper protocol version negotiation during initialization
- [x] Add the stdio transport implementation
- [x] Support connection resumability with Last-Event-ID
- [x] Fix error in processessage typo (should be processMessage)
- [x] Add proper error handling for session expiration (404 responses)
- [x] Implement explicit session termination via HTTP DELETE
- [x] Add connection health check with ping/pong
- [x] Implement cancellation notifications for timeouts
- [ ] Support JSON-RPC batch requests/responses
- [ ] Add client capability for handling server-initiated requests
- [ ] Implement proper handling of SSE disconnection and reconnection
- [x] Add request timeout configuration
